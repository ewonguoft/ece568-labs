<p><b>Lesson Plan Title: </b>How to Perform Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
It is always a good practice to validate all input on the server side.
 XSS can occur when unvalidated user input is used in an HTTP response. 
 In a reflected XSS attack, an attacker can craft a URL with the attack 
 script and post it to another website, email it, or otherwise get a 
 victim to click on it.

For this exercise, you will need to craft a URL that tricks a user into
 entering their credit card number into the shopping page where you have
 injected malicious code.
When the user clicks "Purchase", post their credit card number to the following
 URL to pass this lesson:

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
For this exercise, your mission is to come up with some input containing a script. You have to try to get this page to reflect that input back to your browser, which will execute the script and do something bad.
